# Data Structures in Real Life

## Introduction

Learning data structures is essential for every developer, but to be honest, it could be intimidating for developers who don't have a computer science background. This repository is created to help developers learn data structures in a more practical way. We will learn data structures by building real-life and simple applications.

#### Array and String

- Learn the basic operations of arrays and strings
- Practical Application: Create a simple address book application

#### Linked List

- Learn the basic operations of singly linked list and doubly linked list
- Practical Application: Implement a music playlist

#### Stack and Queue

- Learn the characteristics and operations of these two structures.
- Practical Application: Develop a simple browser history feature (using stack)
- Practical Application: Simulate a print queue system (using queue)

#### Tree(Basic)

- Learn binary tree and binary search tree
- Practical Application: Create a file system directory structure

### Advanced Data Structures and Applications

#### Tree(Advanced)

- Learn balanced trees like AVL tree and red-black tree
- Practical Application: Implement a simple database indexing system

#### Graph

- Learn the representation and basic algorithms of graphs (BFS, DFS)
- Practical Application: Develop a simple social network recommendation system

#### Hash Table

- Learn hash functions and collision resolution
- Practical Application: Implement a simple cache system

#### Heap and Priority Queue

- Learn the smallest heap and the largest heap
- Practical Application: Develop a task scheduler
